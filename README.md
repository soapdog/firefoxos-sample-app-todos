To Do App
==========================

A sample app for Firefox OS for managing To Do lists.
It uses the [Gaia Building Blocks](http://buildingfirefoxos.com/building-blocks/) for its interface.


Usage of Web APIs
=================

This app uses [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB) to store the todo lists.
It uses [Alarm API](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/AlarmAPI) to schedule alarms for specific to do items. The app installation
is handled using [Open WebApps API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/JavaScript_API?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript_API)



Google Summer of Code
=====================

This app was created as a part of a collection of sample apps for Firefox OS during Google Summer of Code 2013.
You can check [my original proposal](https://wiki.mozilla.org/SummerOfCode/2013/FirefoxOSSampleApps).
